Currently learning Nextflow to wrap my workflow in a structural way.
Here are some useful resources:
+ Official website: https://www.nextflow.io/
+ nf-core: https://nf-co.re/
+ Learning documentation: https://training.seqera.io/

  
I also start writing my script in nexflow. You can find more detail in [here](https://github.com/ferygood/nf-STAR-TEtranscript) on my github.
