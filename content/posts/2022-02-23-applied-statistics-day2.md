This post includes the notes I learn from MPI statistics workshop (day2). I have grabbed a coffee :D  

#### A review on 95% confidence interval  
Is it reasonable for always taking two-sided confidence interval or one-side (right or left) confidence interval. Another issue is that more samples mean more money.  
Confidence Interval is determined by the **point estimate** and by the **error of the estimate**.  
The **error of estimate** depends in generaly by the sample variance, sample size, and confidence level.

進入到 Hypothesis Testing 喇 
concept:  
**statistical significance** & **practical relevance** A question can ask yourself is will you create a predicted model based on your 'significant' result. **Critical regions**: these are set of values (normally intervals). When the statistic falls into such a critical region the H0 is rejected in favor of H1.  

Q: How bad is it to have false positive in your study?  
Tests about one mean (Method based on the confidence interval)  

When variance is unknown --> first consider using t-interval instead of the z-interval.  **t-distribution** can be used when the population data is approximately normally distributed. You also can use probability plot graph to see if the population is normally distributed or not.   

Today we do Exercise25
