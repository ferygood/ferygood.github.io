In December, I published the outcomes of my doctoral research as a preprint on bioRxiv [@chen2023] . The article focuses on the analysis of orthologs and transposable elements relationships across species and under different conditions using the R software TEKRABber [@TEKRABber], which I developed. This software stands out for its ability to analyze the most common RNA-seq data, and its key correlation calculations are enhanced for computational speed using RCpp (C++).

As of January, the software is ranked 925 out of 2266 on Bioconductor, the largest open-source platform for bioinformatics. Our next step involves submitting this article to a scientific journal.
