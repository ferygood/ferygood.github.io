On the path of learning data science, I believe at some point data scientists will want to show their results using appealing dashboard and deploy them on internet.

Many data scientists use python to do their daily work, therefore in this post I want to share how to use [plotly](https://plotly.com/) to visualize data and build your plots into a dashboard app using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), and finally deploy your app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). In the following section, most of the scripts are using python.

### plotly

[plotly](https://plotly.com/) is a package that you can visualize your data in different kind of graph. The advantage of plotly is you can directly seeing your data by **clicking data points in the plot**:

```{python}
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 size='petal_length', hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.show()
```

### plotly gallery

If you already have experience with python, I suggest you start with the [gallery](https://plotly.com/python/) for inspirations. You can choose the type of graph you want to visualize your data.

### Dash

[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) is a package for deploying dashboard especially for using plotly. Here I introduce the boilerplate of dash:
