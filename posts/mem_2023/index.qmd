During these four days of talks and poster sessions, I met a lot of nice people working on different Evolution research. I also gave a presentation on the last day about my current PhD work, *Unwinding the regulatory network of KRAB zinc finger genes and transposable elements in the evolution of primate brain*, sharing how we measure and compare expression data from humans and non-human-primates' brain RNA-seq and the development of R Bioconductor package, [TEKRABber](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TEKRABber.html).
